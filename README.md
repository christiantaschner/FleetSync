This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to configure your environment variables.

1.  **Open `.env.local`**: The file `.env.local` has been created for you in the root of your project.
2.  **Fill in your credentials**: Open the file and replace the placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`) with your actual credentials for Firebase, Google Maps, and Stripe.

Once your `.env.local` file is configured, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:9002`.
